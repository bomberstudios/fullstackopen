## Exercise 1.6: Unicafe step1 ✅

Like most companies, the student restaurant of the University of Helsinki Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web app for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

The app must display the total number of collected feedback for each category.

## Exercise 1.7: Unicafe step2 ✅
